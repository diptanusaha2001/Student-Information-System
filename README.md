# Student-Information-System
The Student Management System is a software application designed to manage data of students in an educational institution. The system is built using Java and Swing GUI for the user interface and JDBC for connecting to the MySQL database. The system provides a user-friendly interface to view and manage student data. The system is developed in NetBeans IDE, a free, open source, integrated development environment (IDE), and is highly customizable to meet the unique needs of different educational institutions.

-> Student Management System architecture design has four main components: User Interface, Application Layer, Business Layer, and Data Layer.
-> The system uses Java, Swing GUI, JDBC, and MySQL technologies.
-> The User Interface component provides a graphical interface for the admin to interact with the system.
-> The Application Layer acts as an intermediary between the User Interface and the Business Layer.
-> The Business Layer implements the core logic of the system.
-> The Data Layer consists of a MySQL database that stores the student records.
-> The system provides a secure, reliable, and scalable solution for managing student data.
